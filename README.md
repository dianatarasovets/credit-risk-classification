Overwiev of the Analysis
The aim of this analysis is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting loan applicants' credit risk. Through precise loan classification as high-risk or healthy, the model seeks to support financial institutions in lending decisions.

Results
Accuracy Score: A 99% accuracy was attained by the model.
Class 0 (Healthy Loan): 1.00 Precision Score
Class 1 (Loan with High Risk): 0.85
Class 0 (Healthy Loan) Recall Score: 0.99
Class 1 (Loan with High Risk): 0.91

Summary
The logistic regression model performs remarkably well in detecting healthy loans(Class0), exhibiting a high degree of accuracy. The model's reliability in forecasting loans is demonstrated by the somewhat decreased but still great precision and recall for high-risk loans (Class 1)
